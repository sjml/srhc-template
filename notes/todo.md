## fundaments
* check out typst instead of latex? 
  * generateCodeHighlightingStyle would need to be adapted
  * should run with `--ignore-system-fonts`
* can copyright info come from the site data? (in the tex templates, etc.)
  * epub metadata.md file
* JSON-LD? 
* copy over full Markdown file?
  * lume wants to turn it into a webpage if it's in the downloads folder :-/; maybe adding it directly will fix?
  * maybe rethink the environment flag handling at this point
