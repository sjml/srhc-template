This is a demonstration site for a template for [the static site generator Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). Most of the text is not very interesting unless you like _lorem ipsum_ but it's all here to just show how navigation and everything will work. The template is meant for a "book" style website where you're exploring linear content that is not deeply nested; just sections and chapters, nothing beyond that. I was inspired by [Alex Shpak's "Hugo Book" theme](https://hugo-book-demo.netlify.app/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), but rebuilt this from scratch to work with Eleventy and with my own design goals. 

Note the responsive theme as you adjust the window size, and the varying light/dark modes you can choose from the widget at the top right. The typography has been carefully tuned to be pleasantly readable on a variety of screen sizes and conditions, but of course everything could be overridden with your own custom CSS. There is only the tiniest soup√ßon of JavaScript to enable some small UI niceties like the theme switcher, but it degrades gracefully if scripting is not available. 

If you're interested in the template itself, [it's called "SRHC" and is available here](https://github.com/sjml/srhc-template). It may receive updates as the project it's derived from evolves, but here it is for the moment. 

Below is just dummy text showing off various formatting options. Enjoy!
