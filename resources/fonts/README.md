This directory contains both the original ttf/otf files for each of the fonts. Variable fonts if they're available, with a separate "static" directory in that case. 

If a font is variable, there is also a .woff2 version of it for serving on the web. 

For the static versions, there is both a .woff and a .woff2, since who knows what crazy old tech we might run across that wants that stuff. 

Oh, the LICENSE.txt files! Those are important.
